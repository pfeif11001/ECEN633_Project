# ECEN633_Project
Final Project for ECEN_633


Purpose: The purpose of your project proposal is to outline the project you plan to carry out so that I can help you determine if the scope of the project is reasonable for the course and the time. 

Your proposal will not count towards your grade, but approval of it is required before you may move forward with your project. 

Deliverable: You will write a 1-2 page extended abstract in the format of an IEEE RAS conference publication. This abstract must be submitted to Learning Suite before the deadline listed there. 

After submitting the abstract, we will schedule a time during office hours to discuss the your proposed project and make sure it fits within the scope and timescale of the course. 

Instructions: 

You need to select a project that is closely related to the course; specifically, your project must either: 
1. Build on and extend existing robotics research relating to mobile robotic perception, localization, mapping, or SLAM, or
2. Implement an existing paper or system that builds on what we have covered in the course and evaluates it on real-world data.


Your abstract (and final paper) should include the following sections: 

Introduction - This section should summarize the problem you are proposing a solution to, emphasize why that problem is important, and succinctly sell why your method is awesome. This section should also clearly list the contributions of the proposed method (and paper) above and beyond existing literature. 

Related Work: This section should summarize and describe existing work. It should organize existing methods (other than the one you propose) into groups and for each group describe how your method differs or overcomes the problems inherent to that group.

Problem Formulation: This section should clearly and formally describe the problem you propose to solve. 

Proposed Solution: This section (which may be broken into multiple sections) should clearly describe the solution you propose or plan to implement.

Proposed Evaluation: This section (which also may be broken into multiple sections in the final paper) presents the experiments you plan to carry out and specifically what metrics will be used to demonstrate that the proposed method meets the claims presented in the introduction.

Conclusion: This section summarizes the paper, reiterates the contributions, and briefly describes the importance of the work.
